# Dust
*A Cellular Automata visualizer for WebGL*

<strong style="color:red">!!! Epilepsy Warning !!!</strong> - This program is likely to produce fast strobing effects without warning.

See a demo at [joncole.me/pages/dust](http://www.joncole.me/pages/dust).

## About
Dust is a WebGL-based renderer for visualizing the behavior of various Cellular Automata. It uses [CellAuto](https://sanojian.github.io/cellauto) for the CA simulation and [Pixi](http://www.pixijs.com/) for displaying the output.

## Building
This is a Node project. You'll need [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to build. Run `npm install` to pull the dependencies and then `gulp build` to package the final files into `/dist/`.

You can use `gulp preview` to open a browser window showing the contents of `/testpage/index.html`, which is a demo page for this plugin.

## Usage
Copy the contents of `/dist/` to the same directory as your HTML file. In the HTML file, include both Pixi and `/dist/js/dust.js` (or the min version):

```html
<div id="dust-container"></div>
<script src="./dist/js/dust.js"></script>
```

`dust-container` is the div that the canvas will be put within. Style it however you'd like. Note that the canvas will stretch to fit.
